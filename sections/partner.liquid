<p>Tempera strings won't be sold on any online store. We prefere to work together with professional instrument makers who are interested in sound as we are.
We will soon release a list of partners here as soon. If you are interested in collaboration with us, please <a href="/en/contact">contact</a> us. Lets speak about it.</p>
<p>An instrument is a system of many elements interacting with each other. The strings play an important role in this, but in spite of everything we are strongly dependent on a good setup and therefore on luthiers who know their craft.</p>
